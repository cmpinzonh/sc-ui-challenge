### 1. Project Setup

**Description:** Assuming that you have both [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/es/download/package-manager/) installed you should only need to clone the repo to your machine and run 

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

That will install all the required dependencies for the framework to function.

### 2. Running Tests Locally

To run tests locally you can either choose to run them in headless mode or not, to run tests the old fashion way you need to execute the command:

    ```bash
    npm run test:local
    ```

Otherwise if you don't fancy seeing the browser when executing the tests you can run them with the following command

    ```bash
    npm run test:headless
    ```

### 3. Running Tests with TravisCI
This repo has [TravisCI Integrration](https://app.travis-ci.com/github/cmpinzonh/sc-ui-challenge) which means that with every push to a remote a build will be run, that including attempts to merge to a pull request. Manually triggering a build of a specific desired branch is also possible.

### 4. Calliope.pro Report
I created a sandbox company in Calliope.pro and updated the report generated by [jasmine-awesome-report](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jasmine-awesome-report) said report can be found in: [Calliope.pro report](https://app.calliope.pro/reports/106100/public/df9c87a7-6c39-4acf-ae92-7dcdf29d79ba)
