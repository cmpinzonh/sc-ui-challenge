### 1. Project Setup

**Description:** Assuming that you have both [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/es/download/package-manager/) installed you should only need to clone the repo to your machine and run 

    ``` shell
    npm install
    ```

That will install all the required dependencies for the framework to function.

### 2. Running Tests Locally

To run tests locally you can either choose to run them in headless mode or not, to run tests the old fashion way you need to execute the command:

    ``` shell
    npm run test:local
    ```
    

Otherwise if you don't fancy seeing the browser when executing the tests you can run them with the following command

    ``` shell
    npm run test:headless
    ```

### 3. Running Tests with TravisCI
This repo has [TravisCI Integrration](https://app.travis-ci.com/github/cmpinzonh/sc-ui-challenge) which means that with every push to a remote branch a build will be triggered, that including attempts to merge to a pull request. Manually triggering a build of a specific desired branch is also possible.

### 4. Calliope.pro Report
I created a sandbox company in Calliope.pro and updated the report generated by [jasmine-awesome-report](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jasmine-awesome-report), said report can be found in: [Calliope.pro report](https://app.calliope.pro/reports/106146/public/546d2c4f-8987-4bc7-986d-e36d7309f2f7).

### 5. Picking Scenarios to Automate
1. Join Now Navigation: 
I decided to automate this scenario since the largest portion of the main paage of [ToolsQA](https://demoqa.com/) is taken up by a banner that, when clicked, redirects the user to a selenium trainning website where they advertise their Certification Training, which I assume is what they want most from a new user in their website. 

1. Registration Form: 
Following the flow of the application I noticed there was a button that redirects to a registration form to sign up to the Certification Course, which is assume is of great important to the application since it is the way in which possible customers express their interest of taking part in the course, unfortunately this form contains a captcha which does not allow me to complete the registration flow, but I decided to make sure that every field in the form was enabled to populate and that the 'Submit' button was also available to the user.

1. From Practice:
When deciding what third scenario to automated I opted for the form practice section of the application since it seemed as important as every other option, mainly because it allowed me to better display the capabilities of the framework I created for this challenge and covered many of the things that a QA Automation Engineer has to face on a day to day basis. 
If there was more infomation available regarding the application (say, what features are more valuable for the stakeholders or what features are more prone to failure) I would've taken that into consideration when deciding which scenarios to automate.

### 6. Next Steps
There are a few factors to consider when deciding on taking this framework forward with this particular application, first we must consider that the aplpication was not build using angular, and since we're using protractor, we might want to consider a change of approach. Also to consider is the fact that TravisCI, while being a fantastic free to use option for small scale project such as this, may not be the tool of choice when deciding to take the project further, we may want to get a DevOps person involved who can better suit the needs of the project in relation with pipelines and triggers for the execution of the tests. We may also want to consider involving a BDD approach to our tests if we want to involve people who are not as 'technical' and enable then to interact with the tests.
